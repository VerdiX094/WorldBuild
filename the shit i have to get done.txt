Ore and oil mining
- Ore can be processed into material for parts
- Oil can be processed into rocket fuel
- Ore and oil output dependent on distance to landmark and terrain height
 > Higher - more ore
 > Lower - more oil
 > Closer to landmark = more overall resources output

Ore/oil distribution visuals? idk

Oxygen system because SFS apparently doesn't have one built-in
